#HOWTO create a bootable usb of Kali Linux

## Automatically

Using *Mac Linux USB Loader*

https://sevenbits.github.io/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/

##Manually

- download an iso of kali linux
https://www.kali.org/downloads/

- check *checksum* :
```bash
		$ openssl sha1 <path to iso>
```
-  **Optional** convert iso to img

*It seems that this step is optional. The transferred .iso is fully functional*
```bash
		$ hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o <path to target.img> <path to image.iso>
```
**Note : OS X tends to put the .dmg ending on the output file automatically**

- Use Disk Utility to erase the USB drive to *Mac OS journalised* (GUID Table of partition)

- Get the current list of devices and note the node for the USB Drive (*probably /dev/disk1*)
```bash
		$ diskutil list
```
- unmount the drive
```bash
		$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskn
```
- copy the iso to the drive
```bash
		$ sudo dd if=< path to downloaded.img> of=</dev/diskN>
```
**Note : you can specify "bs=1m" for the blocksize used in transfer. However, it seems that it gets the iso corrupted. Need some testing with smaller values : 512k etc...**

**Note : you can check the progress of dd by pressing ctrl-t in the shell**

- change the EFI on it from the broken default one to Grub.
To do so, mount the disk and replace the EFI folder by the one in the folder (*EFI.zip*). Make sure that the folder is deleted by emptying the trash og your computer (Otherwise, error : "Not enough space")

- unmount the disk :
```bash
		$ diskutil eject /dev/diskN
```
### Try to boot on the disk by rebooting with the USB stick and pressing alt

## Add persistence

To do so, we have to add a new partition to our USB drive and add a *persistence.conf* file in it. We need a tool to format in *ext4*. I created a virtual machine of Ubuntu on VirtualBox on my Mac OS X, since it is not able to format in *ext4* by default. Then :

- Create and format new partitions with gparted. Execute :
```bash
		$ sudo gparted
```

then format all the space available to *ext4*, with label *persistence*, *primary partition*. NOTE that those two parameters are crucial.

- Mount the usb
```bash
	$ mkdir /mnt/usb
	$ mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/usb
```
- Create the *persistence.conf* file : 
```bash
	$ echo "/ union" >> /mnt/usb/persistence.conf
```

- Unmount:
```bash
	$ umount /mnt/usb
```
Then, when booting on the USB, choose **Live USB persistence**

## Virtual Box : Boot from USB Drive

- Unmount USB Drive
```bash
	$ diskutil list
```
find the usb drive, then unmount it :
```bash
	$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2
```

The tricky part is that the VirtualBox process can only read/write files owned by the current user you are logged with. However Mac OS X, had put root as owner. With this default, you wonâ€™t be able to import the disk file that we are going to create. So the solution is too change the permission of the device.

```bash
	$ sudo chown bo /dev/disk2
```

- Create a Disk File
```bash
$ sudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename ~/Documents/myusbdrive.vmdk
-rawdisk /dev/disk2
```
- Change permission of the disk .vmdk :
```bash
$ sudo chmod 777 ~/Documents/myusbdrive.vmdk
```
- Change permission of the USB Drive :
```bash
$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/disk2
```

*NB* you will have to change permission each time you plug the USB drive in.

- Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox and select *Use an existing virtual hard disk file*, to pick *~/Documents/myusbdrive.vmdk*
